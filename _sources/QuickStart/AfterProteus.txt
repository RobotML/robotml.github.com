After PROTEUS
-------------

**PROTEUS** is just a project. Its results (Modelling platform, Generation tooling, convergence towards :term:`ROS` exchanges, :term:`open access to Robotic platforms <OARP>` for outsiders, etc) are to exist after its end because of their use. The :term:`Robotic modelling language <RobotML>` is not dependant of the project, the :term:`OARP`\ s are for two of them to go on living their life, the Community :term:`portal` will be maintained and updated during two years and so on and so forth. It is of the utmost importance to understand that the project is a community service in order to allow increase of exchange and to open market to innovative product shortening time between research centres and industry.
