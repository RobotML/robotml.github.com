PROTEUS and the Robotic community
---------------------------------

**PROTEUS** being a French Project was backed up and is directed towards the Robotic community as represented by its associated :term:`GDR Robotique`\ . In this scope one of its study group (`David Andreu <mailto:david.andreu@lirmm.fr>`_ from :term:`LIRMM` and `Cyril Novales <mailto:cyril.novales@bourges.univ-orleans.fr>`_ from :term:`PRISME`\ , Cyril Novales is participating to the project) is doing the link between the project and the French community.

Contacts were taken with the European Robotic community through the :term:`EUROP / EURON` group and more specifically discussions exists between PROTEUS project and `Herman Bruynincks <mailto:herman.bruyninckx@mech.kuleuven.be>`_ in order to correlate work doen on modelling tools in Europe and in PROTEUS. This action should lead at some point to an European initiative towards promotion of a standardised modelling language and its associated tooling.
