Install :term:`RobotML` Tooling
===============================

In order to ease the :term:`user` work a specific customisation of the RobotML
platform grouping its different components into a unique application has been
done. The :term:`ECLIPSE <eclipse>` :term:`RCP` mechanism has been used to
group:

1. :term:`RobotML` editor
2. Generators towards different opensource tools,namely:

	a. :term:`Cycab-tk`\ : 
	b. :term:`MORSE`\ : 
	c. :term:`OROCOS`\ : it is a robotic middleware developed in Europe nowadays. 
	d. :term:`ROS`\ :
	e. :term:`URBI`\ :

3. Generators towards different company-licensed robotic middleware, namely:

	a. :term:`ARROCAM`\ :
	b. :term:`RT-MAPS`\ :
	
4. Components needed for the platform to run correctly, namely:

	a. :term:`ATHENA`\ :
	b. :term:`SVN`\ :
	c. :term:`VLE`\ :
	
If the platform is able to provide generated code source, there is a need to also install the different associated frameworks. 
It is the goal of the :term:`RobotML-sdk` (see :ref:`Install RobotML-sdk <UG-PI-IPD>` to know how to install it).

For :term:`users <user>` willing to know more, it is possible to see how to create the platform in their classical :term:`eclipse` using 
specific update sites one after the other following :ref:`RobotML platform installation from update site <DG-IFD-RPI>`\ .
