Introduction to meta-modeling
-----------------------------

Meta-modeling means to work not on the domain but on the properties of this domain in order to extract generic features that could be used on many problems occurring in this domain.
In this scope, it means to define the salient features of the robotic domain in order to create some specific language able to describe it easily.

.. TODO
	it is necessary to have a better introduction
