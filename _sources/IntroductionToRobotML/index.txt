Introduction to :term:`RobotML`
===============================

:term:`RobotML` covers many things. In order to understand its underlying logic it is necessary to understand what
are its different parts. :term:`RobotML` is in fact composed of three main parts and some associated tools. These parts are:

1. **A modelling platform** based upon :term:`Papyrus` that allows to represent Robotics systems and associated environments ;
2. **Generators** based upon :term:`Acceleo` and allowing to deploy the models composed thanks to the above part towards a list of targets;
3. **Associated tools** that allow the :term:`user` to compile and execute the code generated thanks to the generators above. There are two types of targets:

   1. **Robotic middleware targets**: This type of targets allow the robotician to ignore the details of sensors and actuators focussing on the processing of information (such as decision taking).
   2. **Environment simulators**: this type of targets allow the robotician tp ake the robot(s) live somewhere, presents information to the sensors and exhibit the consequence of decision taken onto the "real" world.

4. **A Community portal** called :term:`RIM` portal (RIM means **R**\ obot **I**\ ndependant **M**\ odel) where the Robotic community can share models and the like allowing the interactions to occur.

Interactions between :term:`RobotML` parts
******************************************

The different parts presented above are interacting one with another in order to answer the needs as already presented (see :ref:`I_RMLD`).
These interactions have to be understood in order to apprehend the :term:`RobotML` environment as a whole.
The following figure presents the parts and their possible interactions.

The sections that follow are detailing this schematic explaining how the interactions occur and what kind of interactions
exists. This is what we called the 
The *Life Cycle* section details how the interactions are embodied in real life and 
the :term:`RobotML` explains how the different developed tools and parts instantiate this life cycle.

Origin of RobotML
*****************

The :term:`RobotML` platform has been created thanks to the French :term:`ANR` :term:`PROTEUS` project.
It seems polite to say some words about it.
