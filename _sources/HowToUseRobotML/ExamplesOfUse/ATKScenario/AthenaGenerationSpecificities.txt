Athena generation specificities
===============================

Event definition on modelling
#############################

.. code-block:: Athena

   prototype test begin
      event initializing { time == 0 }
      
      stateset ModelState {INIT, RUNNING} = INIT begin
         transition from INIT to RUNNING on initializing
      end
   end
   
To define an Athena event, you should to create an OpaqueBehavior "oInitializing". Select Athena as source code,
and put time == 0 as body value.
Create an Operation and name as Initializing, and apply the Algotrythm stereotype. Assign this op√©ration as oInitializing behavior's sepcification.

To use this event, select a transition in your state machine, and go to the RobotML tab, in the property view.
Assign the Initializing operation as transition's guard or effect. 
 
Signal definition on modelling
##############################

.. code-block:: Athena

   prototype test begin
      signal sigEvent
   
      stateset ModelState {INIT, RUNNING) = INIT begin
         transition from INIT to RUNNING on initializing raise sigEvent
      end
   end
   
To define an Athena signal, you should to create an Operation sigEvent, and apply the Algorythm stereotype.
To use this signal, select a transition on your state machine, and assign the sigEveng operation as transition effect in the propertie's RobotML tab.

State action on modelling
#########################

.. code-block:: Athena

   prototype test begin
      when (ModelState::INIT) begin
         interaction init()
      end
   end
   
To define a state action, you should create an OpaqueBehavioir "oInit". In the RotbotML tab of the proties view, selct Alf as source code,
and complete the body's value on Alf language (you use Athena).
Create an Operation and name as init. Apply the Alogorythm stereotype on this operation. In the RobotML tab of the OpaqueBahavior's properties view, assign the operation as specification of this behavior.
To use this action, select youy state, and go to the RobotML tab of the properties view. Assign your operation and link the arguments.
