robotml.github.com
==================

This project is created in order to provide a test of how the RobotML documentation will appear with respect to its html flavour thanks to the github mechanism providing the http://robotml.github.io webpage.

There is an issue related to this webpage. The website is generated using the sphinx generator that itself uses the RobotML-Documentation repository as its source. Unhappily, it does not obey the needs of the Jekyll engine used by github. There is a workaround to follow each time there is a complete update done (follow https://help.github.com/articles/files-that-start-with-an-underscore-are-missing).
